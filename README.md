# Earthwise-Deterministic-Framework
A transparent, deterministic conservation framework showing how U.S. species can be stabilized within 10 years using low-intensity, distributed interventions. Includes full scoring criteria, audit trace, composite model, and reproducible ranking outputs.

# EarthWise DI² is the integrated environmental logic layer that unifies four deterministic modules:
1. CleanAirWise DI²
2. CleanWaterWise DI²
3. HazardWise DI²
4. EndangeredSpeciesWise DI²
   
EarthWise provides the unified deterministic protocol these modules follow, enabling cross-domain
environmental reasoning.
